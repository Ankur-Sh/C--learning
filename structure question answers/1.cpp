//struct is a way to combine multiple fields to represent a composite data structure, which further lays the foundation for Object Oriented Programming. For example, we can store details related to a student in a struct consisting of his age (int), first_name (string), last_name (string) and standard (int).
//You have to create a struct, named Student, representing the student's details, as mentioned above, and store the data of a student.
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Student{
    int age;
    string first_name;
    string last_name;
    int standard;
};

int main() {
   
    Student st;
    cin>>st.age>>st.first_name>>st.last_name>>st.standard;
    cout<<st.age<<" "<<st.first_name<<" "<<st.last_name<<" "<<st.standard<<" "<<endl;
    
    
    return 0;
